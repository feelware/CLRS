To prove $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$, we need to show

$$ c \cdot 2^n \geq 2 \cdot 2^n \qquad \forall \> n > n_0 $$

For a certain $c \geq 0$ and $n_0 \in \N$.

We can express $2^{n+1}$ as follows

$$ 2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n $$

Let $c \in \R, c \geq 2$. We can now state the following

$$ c \cdot 2^n \geq 2 \cdot 2^n \qquad \forall \> n > 0 $$

Therefore, $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$.

To prove $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$, we need to show

$$ c \cdot 2^n \geq 2^{2n} \qquad \forall \> n > n_0 $$

For a certain $c \geq 0$ and $n_0 \in \N$.

Let's compare the asymptotic growth of $c \cdot 2^n$ and $2^{2n}$ by calculating the ratio of the two functions

$$ \dfrac{c \cdot 2^n}{2^{2n}} = \dfrac{c \cdot 2^n}{2^n \cdot 2^n} = \dfrac{c}{2^n} $$

Let's take the limit of the ratio as $n$ approaches infinity

$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{c}{2^n} = 0 $$

As shown, $c \cdot 2^n$ becomes insignificant compared to $2^{2n}$ as $n$ approaches infinity, no matter the value of $c$. There is now way it could ever be an upper bound for $2^{2n}$. Therefore, $2^{2n} \neq O(2^n)$.
