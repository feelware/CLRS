To prove $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$, we need to show

$$ c \cdot 2^n \geq 2 \cdot 2^n \qquad \forall \ n > n_0 $$

For a certain $c \geq 0$ and $n_0 \in \N$.

We can express $2^{n+1}$ as follows

$$ 2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n $$

Let $c \in \R, c \geq 2$. We can now state the following

$$ c \cdot 2^n \geq 2 \cdot 2^n \qquad \forall \ n > 0 $$

Therefore, $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$.

To prove $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$, we need to show

$$ c \cdot 2^n \geq 2^{2n} \qquad \forall \ n > n_0 $$

For a certain $c \geq 0$ and $n_0 \in \N$.

Let's compare the asymptotic growth of $c \cdot 2^n$ and $2^{2n}$ by calculating the ratio of the two functions

$$ \dfrac{c \cdot 2^n}{2^{2n}} = \dfrac{c \cdot 2^n}{2^n \cdot 2^n} = \dfrac{c}{2^n} $$

Let's take the limit of the ratio as $n$ approaches infinity

$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{c}{2^n} = 0 $$

As shown, $c \cdot 2^n$ becomes insignificant compared to $2^{2n}$ as $n$ approaches infinity, no matter the value of $c$. There is now way it could ever be an upper bound for $2^{2n}$. Therefore, $2^{2n} \neq O(2^n)$.

> Prove Theorem 3.1.

A function $f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if

$$
\begin{align}
  \exists c_1 \geq 0, c_2 \geq 0, n_0 \geq 0 :
  0 \leq c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n) \ 
  \forall n \geq n_0
\end{align}
$$

We can expand statement $(1)$ into two "smaller" statements about $f(n)$

$$
\begin{align}
  \exists c_1 \geq 0, n_0 \geq 0 :
  0 \leq c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \ 
  \forall n \geq n_0
  \\
  \exists c_2 \geq 0, n_0 \geq 0 :
  0 \leq f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n) \ 
  \forall n \geq n_0
\end{align}
$$

We can notice that statement $(2)$ is true for any function if and only if such function is $\Omega(g(n))$. Similarly, statement $(3)$ is true for any function in $O(g(n))$.

We've shown that $f(n)$ being both $\Omega(g(n))$ and $O(g(n))$ can be derived from the fact that $f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$. Now, we need to show that the implication is true in the opposite direction.

By saying that $f(n)$ is $\Omega(g(n))$ and $O(g(n))$, we are stating that $f(n)$ is bounded both from below and from above by scaled versions of $g(n)$, for all $n \geq n_1$ and $n \geq n_2$, respectively. At first, one might encounter a problem with the fact that $n_1$ and $n_2$ might be different, considering that the definition of $\Theta$ requires a single $n_0$. However, we can simply take the maximum of the two values, $n_0 = \max(n_1, n_2)$, and statement $(1)$ will still hold, since all $n \geq n_0$ will be greater than both $n_1$ and $n_2$.

Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n)$ is both $\Omega(g(n))$ and $O(g(n))$. $\blacksquare$

> Prove that $o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$ is the empty set.

Let's assume that there exists a function $f(n)$ such that $f(n) \in o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$. From the definitions of $o(g(n))$ and $\omega(g(n))$, we know that

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(n) = o(g(n)) \implies &\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0 \\
  f(n) = \omega(g(n)) \implies &\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \infty
\end{align*}
$$

$f(n)$ being both $o(g(n))$ and $\omega(g(n))$ implies that the ratio of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ must be both $0$ and $\infty$ as $n$ approaches infinity, which is impossible. Therefore, $o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$ is the empty set. $\blacksquare$
