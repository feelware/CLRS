**2.1-2**

> Consider the procedure SUM-ARRAY on the facing page. It computes the sum of the $n$ numbers in array $A[1:n]$. State a loop invariant for this procedure, and use its initializaiton, maintenance, and termination properties to show that the SUM-ARRAY procedure returns the sum of the numbers in $A[1:n]$.

```
SUM-ARRAY(A, n)

1  sum = 0
2  for i = 1 to n
3      sum = sum + A[i]
4  return sum
```

**Loop invariant:** The variable `sum` contains the sum of all the elements that have been iterated over so far.

**Initialization:** Since we're about to execute the first iteration, $i = 1$, so the variable `sum` should contain the sum of the first $i - 1 = 0$ elements of $A$, i.e., the empty sum which, by convention, is equal to $0$. This is the case, since the variable `sum` has previously been initialized to $0$.

**Maintenance:** The variable `sum` should contain the sum of the first $i$ elements of $A$ at the end of the $i$ th iteration of the loop, assuming that the loop variant holds before such iteration. This is the case, since the variable `sum`, which initially contains the sum of the first $i - 1$ elements of $A$, is incremented by the value of $A[i]$ at the end of the $i$ th iteration, thus containing the sum of the first $i$ elements of $A$.

**Termination:** The loop terminates as soon as $i > n$, i.e., when $i = n + 1$. By this point, following the maintenance property, the variable `sum` contains the sum of the first $i - 1 = n$ elements of $A$, i.e., the sum of all the elements of $A$. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the numbers in $A[1:n]$.
