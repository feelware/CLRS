> Using Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on an array initially containing the sequence $\langle 3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49 \rangle$.

**2.3-2**

> The test in line 1 of the `MERGE-SORT` procedure reads **if** $p \geq r$ rather than **if** $p == r$. If `MERGE-SORT` is called with $p > r$, then the subarray $A[p:r]$ is empty. Argue that as long as the initial call of `MERGE-SORT(A, 1, n)` has $n \geq 1$, the test **if** $p == r$ suffices to ensure that no recursive call has $p > r$.

Asumming that the initial call of `MERGE-SORT(A, 1, n)` has $n \geq 1$, the only way to cause a recursive call to `MERGE-SORT` where $p > r$ is by calling `MERGE-SORT` on a single element subarray, for example, `MERGE-SORT(A, 1, 1)`. Let's see what would happen in this case if we skipped any tests.

```
MERGE-SORT(A, p, r)
1   q = ⌊(p + r)/2⌋          // q = 1
2   MERGE-SORT(A, p, q)      // MERGE-SORT(A, 1, 1)
3   MERGE-SORT(A, q + 1, r)  // MERGE-SORT(A, 2, 1)
4   MERGE(A, p, q, r)
```

In line 3, we call `MERGE-SORT` with $p$ and $r$, the first and second parameters, equal to $2$ and $1$, respectively. This evidently violates the condition $p \geq r$. We can also observe that `MERGE-SORT` is called in line 2 with the same arguments as the current call has, which would cause an infinite loop if the condition was not present.

To avoid this situation, it's sufficient to check if $p == r$ before making any recursive calls.

**Note:** In the fourth edition, both instances of $p == r$ are actually $p \neq r$. This is a typo, as stated in the [official errata](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html).

> State a loop invariant for the **while** loop of lines 12-18 of the `MERGE` procedure. Show how to use it, along with the **while** loops of lines 20-23 and 24-27, to prove that the `MERGE` procedure is correct.
